As you know my LinkedIn profile has been mentioned in my profile and you can easily find out about my professional experience mostly in the field of Virtualization.

But nowadays I'm a DevOps student & a cloud enthusiast who would like to use his current and future experience and knowledge to become a better engineer while I'm challenging myself & enjoying the path itself.
